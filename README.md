# EvoSim

Welcome to my Evolution Simulation Project!
I've been working on this project ever since I started my bachelors degree at the University of Bern and since it has become a hobby of mine to work on this in my freetime.
I am facinated by evolutionary simulations, biology and neural network.
This project is a playing ground where I try out new ideas and features that I think would be cool.
Therefore I decided to create this public repository to share my progress and maybe someone is interested in it too.

## History
This project started as a java project and then has been ported to python.
The next step is to port it to C# and implement it using .Net and WPF.
Currently the porting process is still ongoing.

## Features
Features that where implemented at some point and are planned to still be present after the porting process:
- Asexual and Sexual reproduction
- Neural Networks for organisms
- DNA System including Mutations of various types
- Tile based movement
- Live graphing and displaying of stats
- Environmental factors
